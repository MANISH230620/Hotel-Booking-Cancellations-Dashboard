# Hotel-Booking-Cancellations-Dashboard
#overview
The project revolves around analyzing hotel booking cancellations through a comprehensive dashboard. The primary goal is to understand the patterns and trends associated with hotel bookings and cancellations over a specified period, specifically from 2015 to 2017. The dashboard provides a detailed view of the total number of bookings, cancellations, and successful check-ins, offering insights into various factors that may influence these metrics.

Key Objectives:
Understand Cancellation Trends: By analyzing data across different years and months, the project seeks to identify when cancellations are most likely to occur.

Guest Type Analysis: It aims to differentiate between various types of guests—couples, families, and singles—and understand how their booking and cancellation behaviors vary.

Hotel Type Comparison: The project also compares city hotels and resort hotels to see how the location or type of hotel influences cancellation rates.

Booking Outcome Insights: By distinguishing between desired and un-desired bookings, the project examines which factors lead to successful check-ins versus cancellations.
